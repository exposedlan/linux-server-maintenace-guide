### You want to self-host your own services but you don't really know much about Linux servers or you don't know how to harden (secure) it?

## You're at the right place.

- Keep in mind that some commands could change from a distribution to another.
- As always, replace **\<user\>** by your username and **\<hostame\>** with your server's IP or URL.
- You should always follow the **principle of least privilege**: Components **SHOULD NOT** have access to anything <u>they don't require.</u>
